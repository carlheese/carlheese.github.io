								<p class="abstract">
								We study a voting model. Policy consequences are uncertain and becoming better informed is costly to individual voters. Outcomes are driven by competition in coordination: opposing interest groups compete and each interest group faces the problem to coordinate on supporting the ex-post preferred policy. Coordination is difficult since the information about policy consequences is costly and asymmetric within a group. There are three equilibria and we characterize all,  based on an index that captures the relative severity of each group's coordination problem. The index depends on the joint distribution of the primitives (cost, intensities, prior beliefs). Correlation and dispersion matter. In particular, we find that outcomes may not align with the majoritarian principle in \textit{any} equilibrium, unlike in related standard settings.

								<p class="abstract">
								This paper studies collective choices with information frictions. In a majority election, voters can acquire private information about policy consequences before voting though this requires costly effort. Information frictions alter the power relationships between opposed political interests by turning the election into an informational contest: There is an equilibrium in which the policy preferred by the interest group with the higher aggregate information acquisition effort is elected; outcomes therein represent voters with a minority interest if, they have comparably high utilities. 
Information advantages and internal conflicts of opinion matter: we characterize how information cost and the dispersion of priors modulate the influence of an interest group.

							<summary>[abstract]</summary>
								<p class="abstract">
								Voters decide between two policies in a majority election. All voters share a commonly known preference type but are uncertain about which policy is better for them.  They can acquire private information about the policy consequences at a cost. Thus, political information is a public good. In all equilibria, voters under-invest in political information. We identify another source of inefficiencies: equilibrium mis-coordination. When the marginal cost of information are arbitrarily low, there are two equilibria, ordered by the information investment of the voters. In a large electorate, only the high investment equilibrium is asymptotically efficient.

								<p class="abstract">
								This paper introduces a model of informal collective action. Each citizen decides if to take action---join a protest, sign a petition, speak out in favor of reform in a citizen advisory committee. The citizens’ actions can signal private information to a policy-maker who decides over a one-dimensional policy. The policy-maker is allowed to be biased towards high or low policies. 
There exist equilibria with welfare-efficient policy-choices, independent of the bias, if and only the citizens have ``skin in the game’’. That is, if collective action can be directly consequential for policy choice, e.g., by enforcing a minimal level of reform. Our result bears relevance for the design of participatory democratic mechanisms, such as citizen advisory committees, and provides an informational argument for the delegate model of representation of Edmund Burke.

									This paper studies a large majority election with voters who have heterogeneous, private preferences and exogenous private signals. We show that a Bayesian persuader can implement any state-contingent outcome in some  equilibrium by providing additional information. In this setting, without the persuader's information, a version of the Condorcet Jury Theorem would hold (Feddersen and Pesendorfer, 1997). Persuasion does not require detailed knowledge of the voters' private information and preferences: the same additional information is effective across environments. The results require almost no commitment power by the persuader. Finally, the persuasion mechanism is effective also in small committees with as few as 15 members.

									In many economic situations,  a sender communicates strategically with a receiver not only  to influence  the decision-making of the latter,  but also how certain unobserved characteristics of herself (e.g., unselfishness or integrity) are perceived by the latter.  To study such strategic interactions,  we introduce image concerns to the canonical framework of information design.  Our main result  characterizes how the sender optimally sacrifices  her material utilities to boost reputation by manipulating the communication protocol of a payoff-relevant state.  
We also discuss the implications for the receiver's welfare in various standard sender-receiver games (e.g., settings with quadratic losses or binary states). Our analysis provides new insights into a wide range of applications,  such as how performance evaluation in hierarchical organizations  can backfire  by engendering harmful upward signalling,  or how political candidates may use (and misuse) populist rhetoric to frame the general perception of their competence.

									In many economic situations,  a sender communicates strategically with a receiver not only  to influence his decision-making  but also how certain unobserved characteristics of herself (e.g., loyalty, integrity, or unselfishness) are perceived.  To study such strategic interactions,  we introduce image concerns into the canonical framework of information design.  
We characterize how the sender optimally sacrifices her persuasive influence on the decision in order to boost her reputation, by manipulating the communication about a payoff-relevant state. We describe when this harms and benefits the receiver unambiguously, revealing also that effects  often  depend on the selected equilibrium and are non-monotone in the sender's characteristics.  We illustrate our findings within various standard preference settings (e.g., with quadratic losses or state-independent sender preferences).
Finally, the model provides insights into a wide range of applications,  such as how performance evaluation in hierarchical organizations  can backfire  by engendering harmful upward signalling,  and if and when competitive elections may discipline the instrumentalisation of media channels by politicians.

							The literature on motivated reasoning argues that people skew their beliefs to feel moral when acting selfishly. Leveraging techniques from the Bayesian persuasion literature, we study the information acquisition of decision-makers with a motive to form positive moral self-views and a motive to act selfishly. Theoretically and experimentally, we find that a motive to act selfishly makes individuals dynamically `fish for good news’: they are more likely to continue (stop) acquiring information, having so far received mostly information suggesting that acting selfishly is harmful (harmless) to others. We also find that fishing for good news may improve social welfare and that more intelligent individuals have a higher tendency to fish for good news.

						<p class="abstract">
						In this note, I study a variant of the canonical binary-state binary-choice social learning model (Bikhchandani et al., 1992). An individual would like to choose an action only in the high state.  When making her own decision, she observes previous decision-makers who chose the action. Importantly, the likelihood of observing the action of previous decision-maker depends on the state. I show that when observing the action is more likely in the low state, the individual faces an inference problem: does she observe many actions because the state is high and previous decision-makers had private information about this or because the state is low and previous actions are more visible. In this situation, learning is confounded (Smith and Sorensen, 2000).

This method trades off risky rewards and delayed ones. It has the following two features: first, it does not require functional form assumptions on the utility function, nor elicitation of the utility function; second, it is compatible with both monetary and non-monetary incentives. Requiring only few measurements, it is also easy to implement.

						We study voting on a reform for which the implementation is at the discretion of a politician who is biased against the reform. Valuable information about the efficacy of the reform is dispersed among citizens, and by voting, citizens can transmit their information to the politician. When the politician has no discretion, the Condorcet Jury Theorem holds (Feddersen & Pesendorfer, 1998). When the politician has full discretion, in all equilibria, there is no information transmission at all (Battaglini, 2017). We consider a scenario of ``intermediate discretion’’ akin to political referenda.  When the majority votes against the reform, the status quo is kept. Otherwise, the politician is bound to implement the reform but can choose the degree of implementation. This creates one-sided signaling incentives for the voters. Even when the politician is only slightly biased against the referendum, there are equilibria with ``oversignaling’’  for which the reform always passes, even in the situations where all citizens and the politician prefer it not to.

						We study the design of quality certificates. The certificate holder (sender) tries to convince a receiver of his quality. The receiver benefits from more precise knowledge about the sender’s quality and can costly verify the sender's quality. We show that if the certificate is too selective, in all equilibria, senders of very high quality do not present the certificate; they pool with low-quality types who do not hold a certificate. The high types forgo a signaling opportunity (``understatement’’), but thereby motivate the receiver to costly verify their high quality herself. Conversely, when the certificate is not too selective, there are monotone equilibria where higher types are more likely to present their certificates.
